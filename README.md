# Microbanking and Interest Management System (MIMS)

To get started with the project, read `TUTORIAL.md`

A full-stack web application built for B-Trust Microfinance Bank to digitize core banking operations, including customer management, savings accounts, fixed deposits, and automated interest calculations.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

### Backend (API Server)
*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **Framework:** Express.js
*   **ORM:** Prisma
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Password Hashing:** bcryptjs

### Frontend (User Interface)
*   **Library:** React
*   **Build Tool:** Vite (recommended for faster setup)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

### Development & Deployment
*   **Environment Variables:** dotenv
*   **Containerization:** Docker (optional but recommended)
*   **Platform:** Render / Railway / Vercel (for easy deployment)

## 🤔 Why This Stack?

| Technology | Why We Chose It | Why Not [Alternative]? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PostgreSQL** | Offers robust ACID compliance, advanced features (JSON support, powerful indexing), and excellent support for complex queries and reports required for a financial system. | **MySQL:** While MySQL is great, PostgreSQL's feature set is more advanced for this use case. **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database is not suitable for a transaction-heavy system requiring strict relational integrity and ACID properties. |
| **Node.js + Express** | Asynchronous by nature, making it efficient for handling multiple concurrent transactions. JavaScript across the stack (with React) simplifies development. | **Django (Python):** While a great framework, our team had more familiarity with Node.js, allowing for faster development and easier context switching between frontend and backend. |
| **Prisma** | Provides a type-safe and intuitive API for database access, reducing SQL boilerplate and potential errors. Its migration system is simple and reliable. | **Raw SQL / Sequelize:** Prisma offers a cleaner, more modern developer experience compared to older ORMs or writing raw SQL for every query. |
| **React** | The most popular frontend library with a huge ecosystem. Allows us to build a dynamic, component-based UI quickly, even with minimal state management needs. | **Vue.js / Angular:** React has a larger community and resource pool. For a lightweight UI, React with simple hooks is perfectly sufficient and easier to learn. |
| **JWT** | Stateless, scalable, and works seamlessly with modern frontend frameworks like React. Easier to implement than session-based auth for a REST API. | **Session Cookies:** JWTs are a more standard choice for decoupled API-backend and frontend-client architectures. |

## 🏗️ System Architecture (How the App is Built)

The application follows a client-server model with three main layers:

1.  **Frontend (Client):** A React application running in the user's browser. It displays forms and data, and sends HTTP requests to the backend.
2.  **Backend (Server):** A Node.js/Express application. It receives requests from the frontend, contains all the business logic (e.g., "can this withdrawal proceed?"), and communicates with the database.
3.  **Database:** A PostgreSQL database. It securely stores all data (customers, accounts, transactions) and enforces relationships and rules.

```
[User's Browser]
       |
       | (HTTPS Requests / JSON Data)
       |
[Node.js + Express Server]  <-> [Prisma] <-> [PostgreSQL Database]
       |
       | (HTTP Responses / JSON Data)
       |
[React App (UI)]
```

### Data Flow for a Deposit:
1.  Agent fills out a deposit form in the React UI and clicks "Submit".
2.  The React app sends a `POST /api/transactions` request with the data (e.g., `{ accountId: 5, amount: 1000, type: 'DEPOSIT' }`) to the Express server.
3.  The Express server receives the request. It uses Prisma to:
    a. Find the account.
    b. Check business rules (e.g., is the account active?).
    c. **Create a new transaction record** and **update the account's balance** in a single database transaction (to ensure data never gets corrupted).
4.  Prisma executes the operations against the PostgreSQL database.
5.  The Express server sends a success response back to the React app.
6.  The React app updates the UI to show the agent that the deposit was successful.

This structure keeps the backend and frontend separate, which is best practice and makes deployment easier.
